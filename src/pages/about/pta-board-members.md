## **PTA Board Members**

Our Board consists of 9 elected members. We welcome feedback about how we can best serve and support the Creston community. Interested in becoming a board member? Contact our current PTA President.

### **President**

I joined the PTA board as the Health & Safety Chair for the ‘22-’23 school year. I moved over to the President role for the ‘23-’24 school year and continue in that role this year. It has been a very challenging yet rewarding experience. I got involved because I had a passion for helping students have access to a safe walking or bike route to school. I have a second grader and a third grader, and I enjoy camping, gardening, and being outdoors with my family in my free time. My goal is to make PTA accessible and inviting to everyone in our community.

### **Vice President**

This is my sixth year as a Creston parent and my second year on the PTA Board. I joined as Vice President for the ‘23-’24 school year because I wanted to be involved with all the good work the PTA does for our students. I have a fourth grader at Creston this year and a fifth grader at another school. In my free time I love to run, oil paint, and eat tacos. I’m so proud to be a part of this school community!

### **Secretary**

My name is Amber Porter and I am the PTA secretary at Creston. I have a 5th grader and an 8th grader at Kellogg Middle School. I became the PTA secretary because there was a need and I was not as involved when my kids were younger.  My favorite part of the PTA is getting to know all the parents and helping to enrich the school experience for the kids at Creston. In my free time, I enjoy riding my bike, snowboarding, and seeing live music. My goal for the year is to help increase parent involvement.

### **Treasurer**

This is my fourth year on the PTA Board in the Treasurer role. I have a second grader and a sixth grader at Hosford Middle School. I love spending time in nature with my family and exploring new places. I was inspired to get involved with PTA because I saw how much they did for the school to support teachers and our children's learning.

### **Fundraising Chair**

This is my third year on the Creston PTA Board and I have a fourth grader. I work at the Portland Art Museum during the day and enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, camping, reading, riding my bike, and coffee. I enjoy being involved with the PTA because I like to be informed about our school, the district, and doing what I can to make our school the best it can be. I’ve also met some wonderful people who are working so hard for our kids!

### **Volunteer & Membership Chair**

I joined the PTA Board as the Volunteer & Membership Coordinator in 2021. I have a fourth grader and a second grader. I love to travel, listen to music, try new foods, and exercise (hiking, biking, yoga). I got involved with the PTA because I wanted to build community with other families in the neighborhood, use my skills to help with school programs, encourage volunteerism, and learn more about what was happening at the school.

### **Health & Safety Chair**

**Josh Roll, healthandsafety@crestonschoolpta.org**

This is my second year on the PTA Board as the Health & Safety Chair. I have a second grader and a kindergartener. I enjoy gardening and canning, coach baseball and rugby and loved watching the US men and women's rugby teams get after it at the Olympics this summer. There is so much in the world where we are all but powerless to do all that much about but organizing around our public school, a hearth of the larger community, allows for a place where the benefits of direct action can be seen and felt almost immediately. Putting in the time now ensures our kids have the supports they need and can make up for some of the financial resources that are not available.

### **DEI Chair**

**VACANT,** We're actively recruiting for this role so please join us at any point during the school year. Contact Jenna to get involved: president@crestonschoolpta.org

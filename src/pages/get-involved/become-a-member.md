## PTA MEMBERSHIP 

We invite you to join Creston PTA! Members aren’t obligated to attend meetings or volunteer. Membership dues are $10 per year and give you a vote (and voice) on how we use PTA funds. Please don't hesitate to reach out here for scholarship if member dues are cost prohibitive for you.

## WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? 

Joining Creston PTA means you are also joining Oregon PTA and National PTA. Member dues support advocacy efforts at the local, state and national levels, impacting decisions affecting your child's health, safety and quality of education.

### **Annual Run for the Eagles**

Run for the Eagles is an annual spring fundraiser that engages all of our students in physical activity, community, and camaraderie. Creston students will work with their classmates to run, walk, and roll as many laps around the Creston Park paved path as they can. So, lace up your shoes, get your cheer on, and support our school at the Run for the Eagles! [Donate on Memberhub.](https://creston.memberhub.com/store?limit=21&live=true)

### Winter Wreath and Spring Plant Sales

## BOTTLEDROP (BLUE BAG) CAN DONATIONS

![photo of blue bags full of cans](/img/fundraise-blue-bags.jpeg)

Put those cans and bottle refunds to good use and directly support our school. This program is so easy and provides steady support all year long. **Here’s how to get started:** 

* Get a special blue bag at any PTA event or the Wednesday Urban Gleaners (or email [secretary@crestonschoolpta.org](mailto:secretary@crestonschoolpta.org) and we'll get you bags). These bags have our unique QR code sticker already on them.
* Fill your bag(s) with qualifying plastic, aluminum and glass bottles (no need to sort).
* Bring full blue bags to any BottleDrop center (closest locations to Creston are Safeway on Powell, Trader Joe’s on Chavez, Hawthorne Fred Meyer, and Woodstock New Seasons). These locations have an automatic system where you scan the QR code on the bag, then a door pops open, and you put your bags in. Easy!

## DINE OUTS

Dine-outs are a great way to support area businesses and earn money for our PTA. We work with local restaurants to select a date and time for a Creston Dine Out and the restaurant gives back a percentage of the profit during that time.

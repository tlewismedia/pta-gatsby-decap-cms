## BOTTLEDROP (BLUE BAG) CAN DONATIONS

This has become one of our most successful fundraising efforts!

1. Pick up a special blue bag at one of the weekly library book bag pick ups.
2. Fill your bag(s) with qualifying plastic, aluminum and glass bottles (no need to sort).

3. Bring full blue bags to any BottleDrop center (closest locations to Creston are Safeway on Powell and Chavez, Trader Joe’s on Chavez, and Hawthorne Fred Meyer), or drop them to Creston-parent-owned business: Cnoc (3370 SE 20th) and we’ll take care of them for you!

## DINE OUTS

Dine-outs are a great way to support area businesses and earn money for our PTA. We work with local restaurants to select a date and time for a Creston Dine Out and the restaurant gives back a percentage of the profit during that time. Check out this year’s DINE OUT EVENTS >

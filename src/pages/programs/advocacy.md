## Safe Routes to School

Part of our school catchment area is north of SE Powell Blvd. Many families live close enough to walk or bike but doing so means crossing a high-crash corridor. Along with other schools and organizations we have been making our voices heard and making some progress.

## UPDATE: September 2023

The Creston PTA has been taking part in a Powell Blvd. Safety Accountability Group convened by Oregon Senator Kathleen Taylor along with other schools along Powell Blvd., TriMet, ODOT, PBOT, and other community organizations.

## HIGHLIGHTS

We now have a 20 mph school speed zone on Powell between SE 43rd and SE 49th Ave. Flashing beacons were installed in August as well (one at Sesame Donuts and the other at the U-haul).

We continue to press for more interventions like:

* Speed feedback signs
* Speed enforcement cameras
* Crosswalk improvements between SE 43rd and SE 52nd – including a concrete median at SE 47th.

We continue to encourage advocacy to keep our voices heard, and if you’d like to do so, please use these contacts.

## BIKE AND WALKING BUS

Join the walking bus from north of Powell to the school every Friday! There are also families that walk or bike everyday and we can help make connections.

## CHAMPIONS

Champions offers before and after school care as well as summer and school break programs. Our K-6 curriculum is based on the latest educational research. It uses choice and play based activities to focus on building the three critical abilities that have the most impact on a child’s future success:

- Social-emotional skills
- Executive-function skills
- Inquiry-based learning

## AFTER SCHOOL ENRICHMENT CLASSES

Creston SUN enrichment classes are FREE and available to all students. Your donations are tax deductible and make it possible for us to offer a variety of classes and serve more Creston families. Classes start in mid-October. Registration is per term and spots are limited. Applications will go home with your child about a week before the start of the term.

## D.E.I. and Anti-Racism at Creston

We have the opportunity to focus our events through a lens of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion (D.E.I.), and Anti-Racism. While we can still host auctions and carnivals, it’s also good to know that we can organize literacy tutoring programs, and free parent and teacher lectures on Culturally Responsive Trauma Informed Care. As our efforts start to expand to be more inclusive and thoughtful, we created a co-chair board position for D.E.I.  One co-chair position is always available for a BIPOC, so that there are as few barriers to participation, representation, and inclusion as possible. We also know that a lot of the work first needs to come from the people with the privilege.

## **SEVEN STEP CALL TO ALLIES AND ACTION**

Creston PTA created a **SEVEN STEP CALL TO ALLIES AND ACTION** to help our families embrace Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Antiracism. While this is available to everyone, this project has been curated by white parent volunteers. PART 1 is aimed at educating white people, and when possible amplifying and highlighting Black voices and organizations. PART 2 is directed at all parents, as we all can have a participatory role in how we move forward to shape the future for our children. We also made sure to separate content into family vs adult when appropriate. Whether you go through these resources slowly or dive in all at once, our hope is that Creston allies can become informed, transformed, effective, and organized. All links were valid as of publication June 24, 2020.
